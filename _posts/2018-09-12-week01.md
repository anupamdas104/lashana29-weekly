For the first assignment, our task was to contribute to openstreetmap.org, which is an open source map of the world. I decided to make a contribution pertaining to my neighborhood, Far Rockaway, which I've lived in for five years. Updating the map was very easy and the walkthrough was straighforward, which is great because it allows anyone to be able to update the map since it's easy. I noticed that not all of the fast food restaurants in my area were on the map, so I decided to update that. More importantly, I also noticed that my local beauty supply stores weren't listed on the map. The two beauty supply stores I go to are extremely important to me because I do my own hair and I love beauty. The hair sold at both stores is very affordable and they have a lot of different hair types and colors, which I love because I like to try new things with my hair. I always get braiding hair from the two stores I added. But, they have pretty much anything beauty related, including nail stuff. I love when my nails are done (even though I rarely do them because I like them long and they get in the way a lot), so I buy nail supplies from them as well. Having these stores close to my home is very convenient for me and I'm grateful for their presence. So I figured there would be another person out there that would greatly appreciate knowing that there are two good beauty supply stores in Far Rockaway.
