# Git Workflow Assignment

For this week’s assignment, we had to use Git from the command line in order to become familiar with it. Prior to this assignment, I was already familiar with the Git workflow. I was also familiar with using git from the command line, so I did know a few commands. But, I had not actually used git from the command line in this way. I previously cloned a GitHub repository using the command line, but that was it. I normally always use GitHub on the website. Using git from the command line was pretty easy, and I’m sure that working with it more will make it like second nature to me. It would be nice to get more assignments that force me to use Git from the command line to increase my familiarity with it. Doing this exercise was important because GitHub is where many open source projects are posted. Knowing and understanding the Git workflow is important because we will be contributing to open source projects on GitHub and we need to know how to use Git.
