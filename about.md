Some information about you!

### More Information

My name is Lashana Tello and I love video games. Which is why I want to become a video game developer. I will graduate in Fall 2018 and I'm taking this course because learning about open source software seemed interesting and having open source software is important for the advancement of technology. Being able to meaningfully contribute to someone else's work/software simply because you like it is amazing.
